# Trigate_MOSFETs
# The report discussed Intel's processor technology and how it grew from the 35nm node to the present 14nm node.
# In order to follow the Moore's law, Intel tries its best to come up with new technologies so that it can manufacture even smaller transistors.
# In order to fabricate transistors at nano scale, there are certain problems that need to be addressed like the lithography techniques etc. The report thus discussed these issues.
# A comparison was also made between Intel and its competitor AMD. Finally, the last section of the report was dedicated to the future technologies that Intel is going to introduce soon.
